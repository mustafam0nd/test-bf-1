    <p><strong>Lyrics:</strong></p>
    <p>Ay, what's it with all the tension?
All you motherfuckers want is attention
Two fake smiles for a mention,
No real clout fuck that's demented
Move me to another dimension
Suicide never been the intention
I been down ever since my inception
I been real I been keeping it precious

I been cut, I been keeping it raw
Are you kidding me, are you sure?
No I'm not, yes, oh my lord
Put em up let's settle the -

Bag you up and send you on your way
Loosen up, you been looking for change
Too far gone and you don't have the range
Could not meet her you could not gauge

St Vinnies from my neck down
Fangin for your feed that's a let down
Not white enough put the ket down
Shaky knees get another set down

Bag you up and send you on your way
Loosen up, you been looking for change
Too far gone and you don't have the range
Could not meet her you could not gauge

This shit is a creeper, let it dig in deeper
Decked out in FILA, Messi on FIFA
My girl she a keeper
No typical sheila, keeping it realer
Medicinal healer
Your grass is green, my grass is greener
Dressed all black like Rieder, can't see me like Cena, ay

Ain't nobody cleaner
Dean Blunt the Redeemer, follow the leader
Your girl looking keener, twist that top Ribena
Dream on, dreamer
Sold out the arena, did it all no feature
Turn up the speaker, see you when I see ya
Cut you off in the KIA, ay

Fuck it up on the one time
Fuck it up on the two time
Call me the two time
Blowing up on your timeline
Didn't read the whole guideline
Hop in the Skyline
Walking through on a fine line
Keep you off on the sideline
Driving a red light
Got some shit in the pipeline
Fuck it up with no lifeline, ay

Switched up from street to medicinal
Spirit so holy, it's biblical
Working got dirt in my cuticle
Vessel for heat I'm the crucible
Step back for the Bung Fu Dynasty
Step forward ever so righteously
Reigning on top only rightfully
Loyalty leave you a casualty</p>
